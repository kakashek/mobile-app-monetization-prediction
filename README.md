# App Store Game Price and IAP Value Prediction

This project aims to predict the **price** and **in-app purchase (IAP) value** of mobile games on App Store by exploring different machine learning models. By analyzing key app features (e.g., genre, languages, size), this project aims to support mobile developers in their **pricing and monetization strategy** through EDA and predictive models and evaluate models; performance using metrics such as MAE and R². This project's goal is to provide actionable insights to app developers who seek to maximize revenue without compromising user retention or overall user experience.


## Problem Statement

Mobile game developers face different challenges in a competitive app market:
- Determining the **right price** that balances user acquisition and profitability
- Designing **in-app purchases** that enhance monetization while maintaining user satisfaction
- Leveraging **historical app store data** to make informed decisions about pricing and revenue models


## Aims and Objectives

- Visualize the relationships between key features and the target variables (Price, IAP Mean)
- Build and evaluate ML models for:
  - Predicting **average IAP value**
- Interpret feature influence on monetization strategy


## Tools and Technologies

- **Language**: Python ≥ 3.9
- **Dataset**: [17K Apple App Store Strategy Games](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tristan581/17k-apple-app-store-strategy-games)


## Project Structure

- `main.ipynb`: Contains data preprocessing, EDA, model building, and evaluation
- `appstore_games.csv`: Raw dataset used for analysis and modeling
